        <h2>Sustainable Material Integrity Project</h2>
        <h3>Project Lead | January 2023 – May 2023</h3>
        As Project Lead, I directed a strategic initiative to strengthen
        sustainability practices by ensuring full material integrity and
        building a robust traceability system across the supply chain. The
        project aimed to guarantee that every material collected, processed, and
        utilized in production could be verified for origin, quality, and
        compliance with sustainability standards.
        <h3>ey responsibilities and achievements included:</h3>K
        <h3>Material Integrity Framework – </h3>
        Designed and implemented a framework for assessing and validating
        material integrity, ensuring consistency with global sustainability
        benchmarks.
        <h3>Traceability Systems – </h3>Established smooth and efficient methods
        for collecting traceability data across sourcing, logistics, and
        production, reducing gaps and improving real-time visibility.
        <h3>Cross-Functional Leadership – </h3>Coordinated sourcing, production,
        quality, and compliance teams to align on sustainability standards and
        integrate traceability requirements into daily operations.
        <h3>Technology & Process Integration – </h3>Guided the integration of
        digital tools and data platforms to automate collection, reporting, and
        monitoring of traceability data.
        <h3>Stakeholder Engagement – </h3>Collaborated with suppliers, auditors,
        and internal management to strengthen transparency and ensure
        accountability across all stages of the supply chain.
        <h3>Sustainability Impact –</h3> Delivered enhanced visibility of
        material flows, minimized compliance risks, and supported the company’s
        ESG commitments by demonstrating credible, verifiable sustainability
        practices. <br />
        This project not only ensured smooth and reliable traceability but also
        built a foundation for future scalability, enabling stronger
        sustainability reporting, consumer trust, and long-term resilience in
        the supply chain.
        <h2>ZDHC Implementation Project</h2>
        <h3>Project Member | September 2022 – December 2022</h3>
        Contributed as a project member to the successful implementation of ZDHC
        (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals) standards, aimed at eliminating
        hazardous chemicals from production processes and ensuring safer, more
        sustainable practices across the supply chain. The project was aligned
        with global sustainability frameworks and supported the company’s
        commitment to responsible manufacturing. Key responsibilities and
        contributions included: Chemical Management Alignment – Assisted in
        mapping existing chemical inventories against ZDHC guidelines to
        identify gaps and risks. Process Implementation – Supported the roll-out
        of new protocols for chemical handling, storage, and usage to ensure
        compliance with ZDHC standards. Supplier Collaboration – Worked with
        suppliers to improve chemical compliance, ensuring smooth adoption of
        sustainable chemical alternatives. Training & Awareness – Participated
        in training sessions and knowledge-sharing initiatives to build
        awareness among production and quality teams. Data Collection &
        Reporting – Contributed to the collection, verification, and
        documentation of chemical usage data for reporting and audit readiness.
        Sustainability Impact – Helped establish a safer production environment,
        reduced chemical risks, and strengthened the company’s reputation for
        sustainable and responsible sourcing. This project reinforced the
        organization’s ability to operate in line with international
        sustainability commitments, driving long-term improvements in
